2020/9/29: I have finished the part of TCP code.I can't find the difference from solo connection and multi connection.In the future, I want to come up with a method which can comply many python files at the same time.

2020/10/3: after finding some document on th eInternet, I don't need to  come up with a method which can comply many python files at the same time.I need to think about the problem of buffer.

2020/10/5:try the connection between xerver and client in different Internet,but it is failed.

2020/10/7: 
I got the problem "accept() fails with Operation not supported"
Answer: 
	server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
	server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

	socket.SOCK_DGRAM is for UDP
	socket.SOCKSTREAM is for TCP

I got mistake: "ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused."
Solution:
	server.bind(('', port)) #Bind to the port
	server.bind(('server.bind((HOST, PORT))')

	so that the listening socket isn't too restricted. Maybe otherwise the listening only occurs on one interface which, in turn, isn't related with the local network.

	One example could be that it only listens to 127.0.0.1, which makes connecting from a different host impossible.

Next Goal: connect by IPv6
